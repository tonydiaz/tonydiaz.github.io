I recently finished up a book called "Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation". It was a very in depth look at DevOps. Although the book was published about six years ago the authors have had much experience automating and stream lining many customer software releases. They dive in to every aspect of the development cycle and discuss best practices that still hold today. They don't mention some of the "popular" tools but the concepts are all there. It was good for me to read this to have a better appreciation for DevOps and understand some of the best practices that could be applied to my work.

I recommend anyone who wants to dive deeper in to DevOps to take a look at this book. The authors don't just tell you how to do things but why.

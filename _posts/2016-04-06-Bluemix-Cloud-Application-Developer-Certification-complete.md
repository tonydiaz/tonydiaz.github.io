I completed the IBM certified cloud application developer test in late February. I didn't get around to posting it until now but wanted to get some of my insights down before totally forgetting them. The process of getting prepared was a little hard to navigate. I have a list of resources (some of which I used) posted in my [goals repo](https://github.com/tonydiaz/goals/blob/master/task-breakdown/bluemix-cert.md) in GitHub. Since I'm an IBM employee I have access to local proctor and some resources that are internal but I didn't use any for studying. If you are interested in going after the certification the best resources I took was the Udemy course. 

Hope this list of resources will help others.

Even though I work in Node.JS each day through work at IBM. I'm interested in improving my skills and getting better and finding new ways to build applications. I recently took a good course on Udemy for Node.JS. It is called "Learn and Understand NodeJS". I posted a link (affiliate link) to Udemy below where you can get a discount on this course and more. What I enjoyed about the course is that it dives into how things in Node.js work not just showing you code to copy but having no clue on the code works behind it. It made me have a greater appreciation for Node.js and I look forward to building more apps on it.

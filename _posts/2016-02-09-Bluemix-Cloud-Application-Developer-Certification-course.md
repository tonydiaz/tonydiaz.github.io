I recently completed another Udemy course specifically on the Bluemix cloud application developer certification. This course is fairly new and some of the errors in the content show that. it is a solid training course that walks you through the main points needed for the certification exam. I was pretty good and will only get better as it gets more polished. Although people can pay for this course I noticed that IBM offers two courses to help users get prepared for the certification for FREE. This is unlike AWS that charges thousands of dollars to take one of their prep courses. I was surprised at the free cost considering they could follow suit with AWS. I'm going to take their main certification next, I expect it will be a little more through and contain less errors than this udemy course.
